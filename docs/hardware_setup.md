## Pin Connections
| Component | GPIO Pin | Physical Pin |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| DHT22 Data| GPIO 4   | Pin 7        |
| LED Red   | GPIO 17  | Pin 11       |
| LED Green | GPIO 27  | Pin 13       |

## Safety Notes
- Always power off the Raspberry Pi before making wiring changes
- Double-check pin connections before powering on
- Use appropriate resistors to prevent LED damage
- Do not connect components directly to 5V pins without proper protection 
- Do not connect components directly to 5V pins without proper protection
